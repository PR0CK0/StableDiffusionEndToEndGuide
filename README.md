Got interested in using SD to generate images. Most of the resources are taken from 4chan's NSFW boards, as anons use SD to make hentai. Anyhow, the techniques from these weirdos are applicable to a variety of applications, most specifically LORAs, which are like model fine-tuners... idea is to work with specific LORAs (e.g., military vehicles, aircraft, weapons, etc.) to generate synthetic image data for training vision models. Later stuff may inlcude inpainting for perturbation.
